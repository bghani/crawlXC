# Bash Script for Data Collection

Description

The Bash script is designed to download animal sound metadata from the Xeno-canto API. It takes a specified query as input, fetches the relevant data across multiple pages, and then aggregates this data into a single CSV file. The name of the CSV file is generated based on the query parameter.
