# crawlXC
Crawl the Xeno-canto API 

# Bash Script for Data Collection

Description

The Bash script crawl-xc.sh is designed to download animal sound metadata from the Xeno-canto API. It takes a specified query as input, fetches the relevant data across multiple pages, and then aggregates this data into a single CSV file. The name of the CSV file is generated based on the query parameter.

Make the script executable:
chmod +x crawl-xc.sh

Run the script:
./crawl-xc.sh

Output

A CSV file containing aggregated metadata, named based on the query (e.g., grp_2_recordings.csv).

# IPython Notebook for generating stats

Description

The IPython Notebook xc_stats.ipynb reads the metadata downloaded from Xeno-canto, which is stored in the CSV file generated by the Bash script. It computes frequencies of recordings for different attributes, for instance, countries, genus, species and so on.
